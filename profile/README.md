# OTP Email Sender Using PHP and PHPMailer

## Introduction

Hello friends! As we know, security is paramount in today’s digital age. One of the most common methods to enhance security is the use of One-Time Passwords (OTPs). In this blog post, we'll create a simple and effective OTP email sender using PHP and PHPMailer. This project will allow you to send OTPs to users via email, ensuring an added layer of security for your applications.

## Why Use OTPs?

OTPs are a secure way to authenticate users because they are:

- **Time-sensitive**: They expire after a short period, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
- **Unique**: Each OTP is generated randomly, making it difficult for attackers to predict.
- **Convenient**: Users can receive OTPs via email or SMS, making the authentication process easy and user-friendly.

## Project Requirements

Before implementation, make sure you have the following:

- PHP 7.x or higher
- Composer
- PHPMailer library

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, you'll need to clone the repository to your local machine. Use the appropriate command to do so and navigate to the project directory.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Once you're in the project directory, use Composer to install the required dependencies.

### Step 3: Project Structure

Your project directory should consist of a few essential files and folders. The project will include a `vendor/` folder (for third-party libraries), an `index.php` file (main file), and `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files (configuration files for Composer).

### composer.json

The `composer.json` file is crucial for any PHP project that uses Composer. It contains metadata about your project, including dependencies, scripts, and other configurations. For this project, it ensures that the PHPMailer library is included.

### composer.lock

The `composer.lock` file is automatically generated by Composer. It records the exact versions of each package installed, ensuring consistency for all developers working on the project.

## Implementation

The heart of this project lies in the `index.php` file, where the OTP generation and email sending functionality are implemented. Let's break down the process:

### 1. Generating OTPs
An OTP is generated using a random number. The system ensures that the OTP is always a 6-digit number.

### 2. Form Submission
The form on the webpage collects the user's email address. Once the form is submitted, the email is processed and the OTP is generated.

### 3. PHPMailer Configuration
PHPMailer is configured to use Gmail’s SMTP server to send the email. You’ll need to input your Gmail credentials for the script to work.

### 4. Sending the OTP
Once the OTP is generated and the email address is provided, PHPMailer sends the OTP to the user’s email.

## Step 4: Configuration

Before running the project, make sure to update the email configuration in the `index.php` file. You’ll need to input your Gmail address and SMTP password (consider using an App Password for security reasons).

## Usage

To use this project:

1. Place the project directory in your web server root (such as `htdocs` for XAMPP or `www` for WAMP).
2. Open your web browser and navigate to the appropriate local address.
3. Enter your email address and click "Send OTP" to receive the OTP via email.
